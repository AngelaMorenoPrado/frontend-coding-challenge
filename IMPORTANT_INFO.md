Hello, Locoia developer!
Just a quick note:
1. In the README.md file you can see which parts of the challenge have been implemented.
2. I have decided to implement the "Make a limit of 10 lucky names per day. Each day is arbitrary..." task in a different component, so you can try both separately: the main task (with the majority of the stretch goals) and that task. Therefore, you'll find that there are THREE links on the app: Home, Winners List (shows only the winners list)
AND 'Lucky names per day'.

Thank you!
